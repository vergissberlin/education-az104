# AZ-104 study workspace

> **Unofficial study material.** This is not an official Microsoft study guide
> and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Microsoft. The practice questions
> are original; they are not official exam questions.

English study notes and original multiple-choice practice for the Microsoft
Azure Administrator certification. Designed for a learner with some Azure
experience preparing for an exam around December 2026–January 2027.

**All 82 exam objectives now have documented coverage across five domains.**
See [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) for progress and [the coverage matrix](exam/coverage.md)
for topic mappings. The bank currently contains 322 questions across 311
families and 99 topics, including reviewed variants in all five domains.

## Start studying

The GitHub Pages address is
<https://frank-reichenbach.github.io/az104-prep/>. Deployment status is tracked
in [STATUS.md](STATUS.md). Browser progress is separate from localhost; use
export/import to move your history between them.

To run locally:

Use Node.js 22 or newer. There are no third-party packages to install.

```sh
pnpm start
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8080>. Stop the server with Ctrl+C. The server binds only
to the local machine. The app uses local files and makes no external requests
unless you choose to open a Microsoft source link. Answer keys are available
locally: this is a personal study tool, not a secure assessment platform.

Choose a topic and either practice (feedback after each question) or test
(feedback at the end). Test submissions advance immediately. Preparation keeps
the Next question step. Every question shows its topic. Incorrect results open
automatically and show your selections plus the correct options; correct
results remain collapsed. Multiple-answer questions require the exact answer set.
Progress stays in this browser. Export it before clearing browser storage or
moving to a different browser. Imported progress replaces current progress.

Choose **Mixed · exam domain weights** for practice across all five domains.
The app normalizes the published ranges' midpoints and rounds to whole
questions; restricted missed-question sessions use available families.
**All topics · random selection** samples the bank without domain weighting.
These practice percentages do not predict Microsoft's scaled exam score.

You can also study without the app:

- [Certification overview](exam/az-104.md)
- [Knowledge index](knowledge/index.md)
- [Printable questions](generated/questions.md)
- [Answer explanations](generated/answers.md)

| STATUS.md | Session handoff and next tasks |
| AGENTS.md | Instructions for future work |
| exam/ | Certification overview, objective inventory, coverage |

## Maintain the content

```sh
pnpm run build   # also compiles Tailwind: app/tailwind.css -> app/style.css
pnpm run check
pnpm test
pnpm run build:site
pnpm run test:browser
```

Edit questions in questions/, then rebuild. Do not hand-edit generated/
or app/data.json. Read [the question format](docs/question-format.md) and
[research conventions](docs/research.md) before adding material.

Azure examples are documentation-checked, not lab-tested. This workspace does
not require an Azure subscription. The study material is independent of
Microsoft and does not contain official exam questions.

The GitHub repository is
[Frank-Reichenbach/az104-prep](https://github.com/Frank-Reichenbach/az104-prep).
The default and Pages deployment branch is main. Future changes use work
branches and pull requests; merges require approval.
See [hosting instructions](docs/hosting.md) for the static build and deployment
workflow, [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) for the scope, and [STATUS.md](STATUS.md) for the
next task. Browser tests require Google Chrome (or BROWSER_BIN pointing to a
Chromium executable) and use a disposable profile.

Personal progress exports can be stored under the ignored progress/ directory.

## Releases

Releases are automated with [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)
from Conventional Commits. On every push to main it maintains a release pull
request that bumps the version in package.json and app/version.json and
updates [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Merging that pull request (requires
approval) creates the vX.Y.Z tag and GitHub release; the Pages workflow then
publishes the app. The app footer shows the version and links the changelog.
The repository setting "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull
requests" must be enabled for the workflow to open the release pull request.
